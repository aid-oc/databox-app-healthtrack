# databox-app-healthtrack

Databox application which provides an insight into the relationship between heart rate and location.

## Prerequisites

Currently the combination of [Moves Driver](https://github.com/psyaoc/databox-driver-moves) and [Fitbit HR Driver](https://github.com/psyaoc/databox-driver-fitbithr) is how Healthtrack can build a picture into your movement history and heart rate values at these locations.
